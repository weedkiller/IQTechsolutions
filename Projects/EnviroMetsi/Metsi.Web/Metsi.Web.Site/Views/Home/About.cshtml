                    <h4>We are committed to help you protect our most precious resource</h4>
                    <p>
                        South Africa, as the rest of the world, is becoming increasingly more aware of the need to protect our environment. Fortunately, numerous water and wastewater
                        treatment processes exist specifically for this reason. There is however an enormous amount of pressure on the owners of water purification and sewage treatment
                        works to ensure that the plants are operated and maintained at the highest possible standards to ensure its sustainable existence. This is where Enviro Metsi wishes
                        to be of assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have been involved in a wide range of water- and wastewater treatment processes for various private industries as well as governmental departments all over South
                        Africa. Even though the processes, plant configurations and sizes varied, our dedication remained the same: We are committed to help you protect our most precious
                        resource.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Enviro Metsi is continuously looking for ways in which to assist municipalities and other Water Services Authorities 
                    with the daunting task that they face when it comes to managing, operating and maintaining the Water and Wastewater 
                    Treatment Facilities they are responsible for.

                        Enviro Metsi realizes that complying with all the legislative requirements set out by the Department of Water and 
                        Sanitation, while attending to the details of the day-to-day operation of a water purification or sewage treatment 
                        plant, can be a daunting task.  By allowing Enviro Metsi to take care of the

                        the owner of the works with the peace of mind of knowing that a dedicated team of professionals is involved in every 
                        aspect of this vital function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our dedicated team of Process Controllers, registered with, and classified by, the Department of Water and Sanitation, 
                        furthermore understands the need for a multi-disciplinary approach when dealing with water and wastewater treatment 
                        processes.  For this reason we will <a asp-area="Services" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">OPERATE</a> any 
                        system in such a way as to ensure peak performance of the water purification or sewage treatment system while ensuring 
                        the longest possible service runs of mechanical and electrical equipment through well planned and scheduled routine & 
                        preventative <a asp-area="Services" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">MAINTENANCE</a> procedures, thereby 
                        minimizing unexpected breakdowns and excessive cost implications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team of suitably qualified plant inspectors and assessors can also assist our clients by performing regular 
                        <a asp-area="Services" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">PLANT AND PROCESS AUDITS</a>.  Years of hands-on
                        experience enable Enviro Metsi to make practical recommendations that will ensure the optimum performance of any 
                        Water Services Works while identifying possible complications in the treatment processes before these become critical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These audits also relate to the <a asp-area="Services" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">BLUE DROP AND GREEN 
                            DROP</a> requirements.  Here Enviro Metsi can furthermore assist in the compilation, reviewing, updating or 
                        implementing the various work-plans and documents required as part of these programs.  We are also happy to conduct 
                        “mock assessments” in preparation for an audit and/or would gladly interact with the Auditors in a support function 
                        to a Water Services Institution during these assessments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another key pillar in ensuring the best possible performance of any Water Services Works is the 
                        <a asp-area="Services" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">TRAINING</a> of personnel. Enviro Metsi believes that 
                        this is a powerful means of promoting the development of an organization and the individual potential of its employees.
                        We provide both informal hands-on training and QCTO-registered training to empower Process Controllers to keep on 
                        improving their skills.
