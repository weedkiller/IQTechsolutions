## The Challenge

Covid-19 will affect us all in one way or another, sure, some industries are 
going to be hit harder than others, but at the end of the day Covid-19 will 
affect your most valuable asset, your team members or employees, in someway or 
other.

Olympia being a tool to engage your team members or employees can offer a lot 
of value in these uncertain times, and for the foreseeable future. Let us face 
it Covid-19 is going to leave a long-lasting effect on how people work and 
interact, and we will probably see more teams working remotely. Remote teams 
bring its own set of challenges, and once again, a tool like Olympia can help 
you align your team members all over the world. Keep your culture, lose the 
office.

To support our clients, we have decided to reduce our prices from 
**$7.99** to **$2.99** per user / per month. There is no catch, all existing 
clients will be moved to this new price (you might have to approve it), while 
new clients will only see this price option. There is no 
*for-a-limited-time-only* clause, we at Olympia have always believed in 
straight forward pricing models.

We believe that Olympia is a vital tool in keeping your team aligned and 
engaged in these uncertain times. We are going the extra mile to make our 
product more affordable for your benefit. Finally, we wish you and your team 
well in these uncertain times.

The Olympia Team.
