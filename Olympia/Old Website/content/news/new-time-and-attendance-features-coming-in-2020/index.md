## The Warm Up

By percentage, most employees in the world are paid on an hourly basis, for
example if you look at the data from the USA Labor Department, it is close to
59% in 2018, see the [BLS
Report](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2018/home.htm). As it
turns out this, this section of the workforce is also most in need of
engagement, this is one of the reasons why Olympia provides a rich set of time
and attendance features build in.

This year we are releasing a new and exciting set of features as part of the
time and attendance module that will appeal specifically to organisations and
departments in the service industry. The new feature set will allow you to
manage user time commitments with regards to teams, tasks and clients, in a
clear and self-explanatory way. Additionally, users will be able to receive
points and compete in more ways with regards to time and attendance.

## User Allocation Planner

This new feature will make sure that employees are not over or under assigned,
with regards to commitments to projects and clients. This is also a great new
feature for so-called distributed or flexi teams, where they can kind of choose
there own hours, as long as they do the time.

## Timekeeper Enhancements

Employees or time members will be able to quickly see a history of when they
worked, what is expected of them with regards to time allocations to teams,
projects and clients. Once again, we are spending a lot of design time to keep
this in line with our philosophy that our features should be self-explanatory,
and not come in the way of your daily work. See our API integration on how you
can automate you Olympia experience.

## Organisation Tags

Quickly allocate users to team, project and client requirements with the new tag
feature coming to Olympia. For example, a user can be tagged as a _Developer_,
_Designer_ or _Trainer_, and the requirements can then be tagged similarly, see
the user allocation planner figure.

## Data Export

Quickly export and summarize the clock in and clock data, ideal for users that
have to submit timesheets, or for reporting purposes etc.

## Cooling Down

Employees working on the clock are often overlooked, but in our experience, they
are where we often see the most improvement with a little bit of engagement.
