## Kick Off

All those days playing and watching sports and games are finally going to pay
off, big time, because some of the elements your learned there is what makes up
gamification. More to the point, applying those elements into a non sporting and
gaming context, like your work place, is what defines gamification. The 4 core
elements includes **leaderboards**, **points**, **rewards** and **teams**.

So why would you want to bring some of these elements into your work environment
or private live? Well gamification has been proven to make employees or
coworkers feel more engaged, motivated, performant and often more loyal. The
benefits are too long to list here, and we intent to delve deeper into those in
another post, but too summarize if done right it can produce incredible results.

## Leaderboards

You need to be able to list either employees or teams on a terminal or tv that
is visible to everyone in the company. But, unlike the sporting world or gaming
world, you will require multiple leaderboars, as it is almost impossible to
compare the receptionist with the sales guy.

## Points 

Employess, and in turn the teams they belong to, earn points by achieving some
goal that might be specific to the company or organization, for example show up
on time and you earn 5 points, show up on time the whole week and you earn and
extra 10 points.

## Rewards

At the end of the day, month or year, you might want to hand out an award at the
general meeting, either a medal or a name in the honours list etc. sometimes
just being recognized on a daily basis is reward enough for alot of poeple out
there. There are two types of rewards, so before you run off, please familirise
your self with intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.

## Teams

By splitting your organization into differemt teams and rewarding them when they
acheive their team goals, you further and embrace team work and the results it
bring.

## The Final Whistle

Please remember, just like any tool or methodoloy out there, gamification, if
done right can reap huge rewards, but if done wrong can also have negetive
effects.
